# BetterWater
Minecraft Fabric mod that changes water physics and makes water non infinite. Tested for Minecraft 1.19 and Java 17

Water physics are not realistic or accurate, but work well enough. Uses a cellular automata implementation.

Tries to keep vanilla code intact and will try to fallback to vanilla implementations when possible

- [x] Water can be levels 1-8, and you can no longer create infinite water sources
- [x] Buckets can play 1 water level using shift, and can pickup non water source blocks (level 8)
- [x] Bottles can be customized to pickup amount of levels
- [x] Water blocks with level 1 can evaporate (Might remove or rework, does not really work well in its current state)
- [ ] Rainfall adds to water
- [ ] Pumps/pipes of some sort?
- [ ] Custom block for infinite source? (Spring possible?)
